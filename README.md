# IDM-Universial-Activator

As any good pirate should, I decided to help contribute by making a patch to create or change an existing license for IDM via the registry.

### Notice

Tested and working on IDM v 6.3.1. This "patch" is intended to be "universial" meaning to working on the current major release (v6.x) of IDM.

### How does it work?

1) license object made up of 3 key/value pairs (FName, LName and Serial) then injects these into the registry under IDM.

2) The exe is patched (in place) - Kudos to [Joexv](https://github.com/Joexv) for this

### Instructions

1) Download and install [IDM](https://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/)

2) Run "IDM Universial Activator.exe" to create the license and activate IDM
